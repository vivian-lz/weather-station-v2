# weather-station-v2
To expand on my first weather station product, I am creating a more advanced version that uses PCB design, I2C communication, and STM32/ESP32 microcontrollers.

The first iteration utilizes the ESP32 module as the base microcontroller and a BME280 module as the main chip that senses the temperature, humidity, pressue, and approximate altitude. This PCB has been created but has not yet been assembled or manufactured.

Since circuits that utilize modules often are constrained by size and control over communication, I also wanted to dive deeper into circuit design by creating a device that utilizes the raw IC chips rather than just modules. I am currently in the process of creating the schematic for this device, which utilizes an ESP32 C6FH4 and the raw BME280 IC. In addition, it utilizes USB-C connection with a USB-to-Serial chip for communication as well as a MIC5365 LDO to drop the voltage that enters the USB from 5 to 3.3 V before it enters the ESP32 chip to avoid frying the chip/board. This device also includes a 40 kHz crystal to generate a constant clock signal for the device and a reset button to manually reset the ESP32 if needed. Finally, the device still contains the traditional RGB and the LCD of the original design to display information in different ways.
